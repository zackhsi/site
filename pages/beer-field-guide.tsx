    <h2>Singapore</h2>
    <h3>
      <a href="https://pinkblossomsbrewing.com/">Pink Blossoms Brewing</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Pink Blossoms is a local treasure, brewed here in Singapore. You won't
      find anything fresher. Their beer can be enjoyed on site from the tap, or
      at home in cans.

      <a href="https://www.heartofdarknessbrewery.com.sg/">
        Heart of Darkness Brewery
      </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Heart of Darkness was my first love when I arrived in Singapore. They
      boast a wide variety of brews, owing to their fast build-test-deploy
      cycle. Heart of Darkness brews in Saigon, centrally located for APAC
      distribution.

    <h2>San Francisco</h2>
    <h3>
      <a href="https://fieldworkbrewing.com/">Fieldwork Brewing</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Bars and restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area commonly list
      "Fieldwork IPA" on their menu. If they could be more specific, they would.
      The thing is, Fieldwork ships them new IPAs faster than they can print
      menus!
